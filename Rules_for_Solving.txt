While solving any pattern problem, irrespective of the language, there are 4 crucial rules for solving such problems:

Rule 1 -> Always use nested loops for printing patterns.

Rule 2 -> The outer loop in a nested loop is used to count the number of rows, whereas the inner loops count the number
          of columns.

Rule 3 -> We need to form a logic between number of rows and columns depending on the question asked.

Rule 4 -> Some patterns demand us to observe symmetry in them. This statement will be more clear as you go on solving
          more pattern problems.

These 4 rules are not my original, but are essential rules that I referred to while solving these problems.
